I am a ~~chemical engineer~~, ~~physical chemist~~, ~~brewer~~ faculty member of the department of Chemistry and Biochemistry here at Cal Poly.  Since 2010, I have roamed the halls of Buildings 38, 52 & 180, looking for people who might be interested in kinetics, thermodynamics or statistical mechanics - but just don't know it yet.
